The error message indicates that the authentication for the PostgreSQL user "postgres" has failed. This typically occurs due to incorrect username or password during the setup process.

Here’s how to resolve this issue:

### 1. **Verify the Password**
   - Ensure you are entering the correct password for the `postgres` user. If you set a password during the PostgreSQL installation, it must match.

### 2. **Reset the Password**
   If you don’t remember the password, you can reset it:
   - `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\pg_hba.conf`
   - Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file, typically found in the PostgreSQL data directory.
   - Change the authentication method for the `postgres` user to `trust`:
   
     ```
    local   all   postgres   trust
    host    all   all       127.0.0.1/32   trust
    host    all   all       ::1/128        trust
     ```
     
### 3. **Add PostgreSQL to System PATH**
   - Find the `bin` directory in the PostgreSQL installation folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin`).
   - Add it to your system's PATH environment variable:
     1. Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
     2. Click on "Advanced system settings" → "Environment Variables."
     3. Under "System Variables," find `Path` and click "Edit."
     4. Click "New" and paste the path to the `bin` directory.
     5. Click "OK" to save the changes.
   - Restart the Command Prompt to apply the changes.

   - Restart the PostgreSQL service.
   - Log in without a password:
     ```bash
     psql -U postgres
     ```
   - Set a new password:
     ```sql
     ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'newpassword';
     ```
   - Revert the `pg_hba.conf` file authentication method back to `md5` or `scram-sha-256` as it was initially, and restart the service.

### 4. **Check the Port**
   - Confirm that PostgreSQL is running on port `5432`. If not, update the setup tool to use the correct port.

### 5. **Permissions**
   - Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running and the `postgres` user has sufficient permissions.
